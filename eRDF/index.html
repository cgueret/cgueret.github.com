			<h3>eRDF query engine</h3>

			<p>
				The Web of Data is growing at an amazing rate as more and more
				data-sources are being made available online in RDF, and linked. At
				the same time specialised triple-stores, such as Virtuoso, OWLIM or
				4store, have matured into powerful engines that can efficiently
				answer queries for a given schema over static data sets of billions
				of curated RDF triples. However, in many cases the schema is not
				known, nor is the precise nature of the search query, and the query
				engine as to deal with imperfect data. The presence of many SPARQL
				end points is also a challenge for querying them in a federated way.

				eRDF is a novel query engine developed at the <a
					href="http://www.vu.nl/">Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam</a> and <a
					href="http://dans.knaw.nl/">Data Archiving and Networked
					Services</a>. It uses the robustness of evolutionary algorithms to
				answer complex SPARQL query over many end points.
			</p>

			<h3>Usage</h3>
			<p>Let's suppose you want to find some persons and the capital of
				the country they live in:</p>

			<pre><code>PREFIX rdf: &lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&gt;
PREFIX foaf: &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/&gt;
PREFIX rdfs: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#&gt;
PREFIX db: &lt;http://dbpedia.org/ontology/&gt;
 
SELECT DISTINCT ?person ?first ?last ?home ?capital WHERE {
    ?person  rdf:type         foaf:Person.
    ?person  foaf:firstName   ?first.
    ?person  foaf:family_name ?last.
    OPTIONAL {
    ?person  foaf:homepage    ?home.
    }
    ?person  foaf:based_near  ?country.
    ?country rdf:type         db:Country.
    ?country db:capital       ?capital.
    ?capital rdf:type         db:Place.
}
ORDER BY ?first</code></pre>
			<p>Such a query can be answered by combining data from the dog
				food server and dbpedia. More data sets may also contain list of
				people but let’s focus on researchers as a start. We’ll have to
				indicate to eRDF which are the end points to query, this is done
				with a simple csv listing:</p>
			<pre><code>DBpedia;http://dbpedia.org/sparql
Semantic Web Dog Food;http://data.semanticweb.org/sparql</code></pre>

			<p>Assuming the query is saved into a "people.sparql" file and
				the end points list goes into a "endpoints.csv", the query engine is
				called like this:</p>
			<pre><code>java -cp nl.erdf.datalayer-sparql-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar nl.erdf.main.SPARQLEngine -q people.sparql -s endpoints.csv -t 5</code></pre>
			<p>The query will first be scanned for its basic graph patterns,
				all of them will be grouped and sent to the eRDF optimiser as a set
				of constraints to solve. Then, eRDF will look for solutions matching
				as many of these constraints as possible and push back all the
				relevant triples found back into an RDF model. After some time (set
				with the parameter “t”), eRDF is stopped and Jena is used to issue
				the query over the model that was just populated. The answers are
				then displayed, along with a list of the data sources that
				contributed in finding them.</p>
			<p>If you don’t know which end points are likely to contribute to
				the answers, you can just query all of the WOD and see what
				happens... ;-) The package comes with a tool to fetch a list of
				SPARQL end points from CKAN, test them and create a configuration
				file. It gets called like that:
			<pre><code>java -cp nl.erdf.datalayer-sparql-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar nl.erdf.main.GetEndPointsFromCKAN</code></pre>
			<p>After a few minutes, you will get a "ckan-endpoints.csv"
				allowing you to run query the WoD from your laptop.</p>
